===============================================  CALL COMPONENT  ======================================================================
---- Call ---
Purpose: The Call component is probably a pre-built React component designed to handle the rendering and
management of video call sessions. It encapsulates the UI elements needed for a video call, such as video
feeds, controls for muting/unmuting audio or video, and buttons for starting or ending the call.
Usage: You would typically use the Call component within your application's JSX to initiate or display a 
video call. It might require props to configure the call, such as participant IDs, call settings, or event 
handlers for call-related actions.

-----Example usage: ------
<Call
  userId="user123"
  partnerId="partner456"
  onCallEnd={() => console.log('Call has ended')}
/>







========================================= useStreamVideoClient HOOK  ======================================================================

--------- useStreamVideoClient ----------
Purpose: As previously discussed, useStreamVideoClient is a custom React hook provided by the SDK. Its 
primary role is to abstract away the complexities involved in managing video streams within a React 
application. This includes initializing video players, handling video playback states, and managing
video call lifecycles.
Usage: You would use this hook in functional components where you need to control video streaming 
functionalities programmatically. It returns objects and functions that allow you to interact with the 
video stream, such as starting/stopping the stream, adjusting volume, or reacting to stream events.

--------- Example usage ---------
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { videoPlayer, playVideo, pauseVideo } = useStreamVideoClient();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render your video player here */}
      <button onClick={playVideo}>Play</button>
      <button onClick={pauseVideo}>Pause</button>
    </div>
  );
};







========================================= Stream Components  ======================================================================
The imports you've listed come from the @stream-io/video-react-sdk, a library designed to facilitate the 
integration of video calling features into React applications. Each imported item serves a specific purpose
in enhancing the user experience and functionality of video calls. Let's explore what each of these 
components and hooks offers:


------CallControls------
Purpose: Provides a set of controls for managing a video call, such as buttons for muting/unmuting microphone,
turning camera on/off, and ending the call. These controls are essential for users to interact with the call
session.


-----CallParticipantsList----
Purpose: Displays a list of participants currently in the video call. This component helps users see who 
else is in the call, facilitating better communication and coordination.




-------CallStatsButton--------
Purpose: Offers a button that, when clicked, displays statistics about the ongoing call. Statistics may 
include network performance metrics, video/audio quality indicators, and other diagnostic information
useful for troubleshooting call issues.




------PaginatedGridLayout------
Purpose: A layout component that arranges video feeds in a grid format, supporting pagination for scenarios
where there are many participants. This ensures that even large calls remain manageable and visually 
organized.





---------SpeakerLayout-------
Purpose: Automatically highlights the speaker's video feed, making it easier for participants to identify
who is currently speaking. This enhances the call's usability, especially in meetings with multiple
speakers.





---------useCallStateHooks-------
Purpose: A collection of React hooks that provide access to the state and lifecycle events of a video call.
These hooks enable developers to build custom behaviors and interactions around the call's state, such as 
reacting to changes in the call's status (e.g., started, ended) or the presence of participants.




-------Usage Context-------
These components and hooks are designed to work together to create a comprehensive video calling experience 
within a React application. By importing them from the @stream-io/video-react-sdk, developers can leverage 
pre-built UI elements and state management solutions to quickly implement video calling features without
needing to build everything from scratch.

For example, integrating CallControls and CallParticipantsList into a call component would allow users 
to easily manage their participation in the call and see who else is present. Meanwhile, useCallStateHooks 
could be used to dynamically adjust the UI based on the call's current state, such as disabling certain 
controls when the call is not active.

Each of these imports contributes to a modular and customizable approach to adding video calling capabilities
to web applications, making it easier for developers to create rich, interactive video experiences.
